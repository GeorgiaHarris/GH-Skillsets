<h1>What I'm Good At</h1>

<h2>An Overview</h2>
My skillsets operate on the logic that good things come in three's. The three areas I focus on most in my professional development are technical skills, creative skills, and people skills. Each one can stand on its own, but its full potential is bolstered by the other two. It takes technical skills to build a database from the ground up. It takes creative skills to put together visualizations that look good, make sense, and tell a story that keeps an audience hooked. It takes people skills to stand up and present that story in front of a meeting room and to answer any questions that come up, no matter how out of left field they may be. Being able to fill any of these three roles in a team has served me well thus farâ€”just as well as it can serve you.

I graduated from Birmingham's Indian Springs School in 2019 with a 3.56 GPA. With the help of a family friend who happened to be an Alumn, I was pointed towards the University of Denver's BIA program.
